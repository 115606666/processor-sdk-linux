	  Say Y here, if your user-space applications are capable of
	  notifying the frame buffer driver when a change has occured in
          the frame buffer content and thus a reload of the image data to
	  the external frame buffer is required. If unsure, say N.

          On systems in which video memory is in system memory
          (SDRAM) this will speed up graphics DMA operations.
          If you have such a system and want to use rotation
          answer yes. Answer no if you have a dedicated video
          memory, or don't use any of the accelerated features.
