* Palmas 32KHz clocks *

Palmas device has two clock output pins for 32KHz, KG and KG_AUDIO.

This binding uses the common clock binding ./clock-bindings.txt.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be "ti,palmas-clk".
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1. The clock id for
		different clocks are:
			0 for CLK32K_KG
			1 for CLK32K_KG_AUDIO.
		The macros of clocks id for DTS is defined at
			dt-bindings/mfd/palmas.h

Optional subnode:
	The clock node has optional subnode to provide the init configuration of
	clocks like sleep control.

	The subnode name is fixed and it should be
		clk32k_kg for the 32KHz KG clock.
		clk32k_kg_audio for the 32KHz KG_AUDIO clock.

	Optional subnode properties:
	ti,external-sleep-control: The external enable input pins controlled the
		enable/disable of clocks.  The external enable input pins ENABLE1,
		ENABLE2 and NSLEEP. The valid values for the external pins are:
			1 for ENABLE1
			2 for ENABLE2
			3 for NSLEEP.
		Option 0 or missing this property means the clock is
		enabled/disabled via register access and these pins do
		not have any control.
		The macros of external control pins for DTS is defined at
			dt-bindings/mfd/palmas.h

Example:
	#include <dt-bindings/mfd/palmas.h>
	...
	palmas: tps65913@58 {
		...
		clock {
			compatible = "ti,palmas-clk";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			clk32k_kg {
				ti,external-sleep-control = <PALMAS_EXT_CONTROL_PIN_NSLEEP>;
			};
		};
		...
	};
