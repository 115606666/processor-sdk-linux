OMAP PHY

OMAP USB2 PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "ti,omap-usb2"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device.
 - #phy-cells: determine the number of cells that should be given in the
   phandle while referencing this phy.
 - clocks: phandle to PHY clocks i.e. 32KHz wakup clock and 960MHz clock.
   Use as per Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
 - clock-names: should contain "wkupclk" and "refclk".

Optional properties:
 - ctrl-module : phandle of the control module used by PHY driver to power on
   the PHY.

This is usually a subnode of ocp2scp to which it is connected.
